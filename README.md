### Arduino UNO Buzzer Control

### Description
This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino UNO to control a buzzer. The buzzer will alternate between on and off states every second, creating a simple beeping sound. This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn about digital output control using the Arduino platform.

### Components Needed
1. **Arduino UNO**: The microcontroller board that will run the program.
2. **Active Buzzer Module**: A component that produces sound when activated.
3. **Breadboard**: A platform for prototyping electronic circuits.
4. **Jumper Wires**: Wires to connect the Arduino, buzzer, and breadboard.

### Instructions
1. **Wiring the Buzzer**:
   - Connect the positive pin of the active buzzer to digital pin 8 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the negative pin of the active buzzer to one of the GND (ground) pins on the Arduino.

2. **Connecting the Arduino**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino UNO to your computer.

3. **Setting Up the Arduino IDE**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write or paste the provided code into the IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino by clicking the upload button.

4. **Observing the Buzzer**:
   - After the code is uploaded, the buzzer should start beeping with one-second intervals between each beep.
   - If the buzzer does not beep, double-check the wiring connections and ensure that the code was uploaded correctly.

### Summary
By following these steps, you will create a simple circuit that controls a buzzer using an Arduino UNO. This project helps beginners understand how to manage digital outputs and timing functions with an Arduino, providing a foundation for more complex projects.
